- **Logical**: Do the premises support the conclusion?

- **Clear**: Is the paper easy to read and understand?

- **Credible**: Is there enough high quality evidence (cited using APA)?

- **Critical**: Does the paper address weaknesses in the argument (e.g. logic, evidence, consider counter-arguments)?
