Preparing for the Final Paper

In preparation for your final paper you must submit to Canvas your choice for the most important current event of your lifetime that happened OUTSIDE the borders of the United States.

By "event" I mean a specific thing that happened on a specific date (e.g. actor X did Y on date Z and that impacted this person, group, or area in these specific ways...).

You cannot submit an event that has already been submitted (first-come, first-served).

Submit:

1. Submit an APA formatted reference for the evidence describing the event,

2. Explain the key components of your chosen event (e.g. who is involved? what is happening? what are the stakes?), and

3. Briefly explain why you argue this is the most important event of your lifetime.
