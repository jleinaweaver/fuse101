- Conclusion

- Premises

- Inductive arguments
:::

::: notes

Let's go through the basics of an argument using the Labossiere (2008) reading

WHAT IS A CONCLUSION?
(This is the claim that is supposed to be supported by the premises.)

WHAT IS A PREMISE?
(A premise is a claim given as evidence or a reason for accepting the conclusion.)

In this class, and throughout the social sciences, we tend to rely on inductive rather than deductive validity as our test of logic.

HOW DO I KNOW IF AN INDUCTIVE ARGUMENT IS LOGICAL?
(If we accept the premises as true then the conclusion is likely to be true.)
(- By these terms, inductive arguments are either strong or weak.)


QUESTIONS ON THE LABOSSIERE READING?

<br>

For the rest of today we're going to explore an important question AND practice two skills we will use a TON this semester.

1. Diagramming arguments and 

2. evaluating the strength of their logic

Let's dig into the Labott argument.

* ON BOARD *

WHAT'S THE CONCLUSION TO THIS ARGUMENT?
(Therefore, ...)

- Covid-19 has and will confront EVERY country in the world with a serious threat of political violence in the coming years.
- COVID-19 was the “first domino in a chain of events that ignited more longstanding and deep-seated grievances,” with impacts that will reverberate for years.



EVERYBODY TAKE A FEW MINUTES ON YOUR OWN TO IDENTIFY THE KEY PREMISES IN THIS ARTICLE.

One way to think about finding the premises is to look at the structure of the article itself. 

Each paragraph should advance the argument in a useful way.

Describing the aim of the paragraph is one way to identify what the author thinks is important to her argument.

COMPARE ARGUMENT DIAGRAMS WITH THE PAIR NEXT TO YOU.


AS A CLASS, TIME FOR PREMISES!

* Call on people, chance to learn names *

(- History shows pandemics are incubators of social unrest)
(- Covid exacerbates the problems of economic and social inequality)
(- National efforts to stop covid may have saved lives but also "inadvertently deepened [these] vulnerabilities")
(- The global vaccine shortage is fueling the instability.)
(- Covid is reducing "public confidence in governments and institutions" and that is "a key driver of instability.")
(- Covid is reducing social cohesion and increasing polarization)
(- The damages of covid done to our societies will be long-lasting and may not show up for years.) 

(- COVID-19 exposed America’s fault lines: The country lacked the social and political capital necessary to properly respond; got bogged down in political polarization, brinkmanship, and gridlock at every level; and is drowning in a miasma of misinformation.)





LET'S TIGHTEN THIS UP, ANY PREMISES WE CAN COMBINE? ANY WE SHOULD REMOVE?

Let's aim to diagram the underlying ideas rather than just copying word-for-word from the text.




ARE WE HAPPY WITH THIS DIAGRAM OF THE ARGUMENT?
- HAVE WE COVERED THE MAIN POINTS?


ARE WE CONVINCED WE GOT THE CONCLUSION RIGHT?


BY THE TERMS OF INDUCTIVE REASONING, IS THIS A STRONG OR WEAK ARGUMENT?
- MAKE YOUR CASE!


HOW CONVINCING IS THE ARGUMENT?


WHAT ARE ITS STRONGEST AND WEAKEST POINTS?


WHAT ARE POSSIBLE COUNTER-ARGUMENTS TO LABOTT?

(- Covid has led to scientific breakthroughs)
(- Covid has led to increased social spending that has dramatically reduced childhood poverty in the US)
(- ...

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-blue_triangles_flipped.png" .center}

Bring to class a news article describing the **most important current event** happening right now. 

You must submit an **APA formatted reference** for your article to our shared document and a one sentence answer to the question "What specific event did you choose?"

::: notes

The case you choose to submit represents your argument!

By choosing it you are telling us you believe it is both  "important" and "a current event".

- "Event" means a singular happening, e.g. one thing

- "Current" means ongoing, e.g. happening now

- "Most important"? Well, that's on you to define and defend.
