- Conclusion

- Premises

- Inductive arguments
::::

::: notes
I want to use the Labossiere reading to highlight the key components of a high quality argument.

- Again, these are the elements you will need to write papers and make arguments in this class.

<br>

### REVEAL: According to Labossiere (2008), what is the conclusion of an argument?
+ (This is the main point of the argument, e.g. the thesis or key takeaway)

<br>

### REVEAL: According to Labossiere (2008), what is a premise?
+ (A premise is a claim given as evidence or a reason for accepting the conclusion.)

So, the basic structure of every logical argument is a series of premises that support a conclusion.

### Make sense?

<br>

**REVEAL:** Induction represents how we think about the quality of the connection between our premises and our conclusion.

- In this class, and throughout the social sciences, we tend to rely on inductive reasoning.

- This is a form of reasoning that moves from the specific to the general

- e.g. An argument that provides a series of empirical observations that all support a more general conclusion
    
<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's look at some examples
:::



## Inductive Arguments {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

**From the Specific to the General**

<br>

::: {.incremental}
- In the summer, there are ducks on our pond. Therefore, summer will likely bring ducks to our pond.

- Every cat that you've observed purrs. Therefore, most cats must purr.

- All the children in this daycare center like to play with Lego. Therefore, all children probably like to play with Lego.
:::

::: notes
**REVEAL each example (x3)**

<br>

**Does everyone see how each of these arguments build from a specific premise to a general conclusion?**

- Inductive arguments use specific premises to support a more general conclusion

- Inductive arguments often use indicator words: probably, likely, tends to, etc

- Inductive arguments often make claims about the future based on the way things have typically happened in the past

<br>

### Questions on the basic structure of an inductive argument?

<br>

Inductive arguments can also be classified as either strong or weak.

- Our goal is to make arguments as strong as possible because stronger arguments are more likely to be convincing arguments!

- A "strong" inductive argument "succeeds in having its conclusion be probably true, given the truth of the premises" ([Critical thinking book](https://iu.pressbooks.pub/shockeyphilp102summer/chapter/inductive-arguments/)).

- In other words, if we assume these premises are true is the conclusion more likely to be true.

<br>

### Are all of these "strong" inductive arguments? Why or why not?
- (They are, but that doesn't mean they have to be convincing!)

<br>

All of this should become clearer as we practice.

For today I asked you to dive into a big ongoing debate

- Should we let the Ukrainians use US weapons against Russian targets in Russia?

<br>

*Split class in half and assign one op-ed to each group*

- Go sit with your group and claim some space on the board!

<br>

Let's first talk conclusions.

- **What's the big conclusion of the Acton (2024) argument?**
    - ("The United States should decline to further loosen its restrictions on the use of U.S.-supplied weapons.")

- **What's the big conclusion of the Fedorenko (2024) argument?**
    - (The US should provide F-16 fighters AND let the Ukrainians strike Russian targets in Russia)

<br>

Ok groups, those are your targets!

- Your job now is to fill in the key premises that support this conclusion

- Feel free to draw on the class submissions on Canvas!

- Go!

<br>

Groups, now evaluate your assigned argument

- Is this argument inductively valid?

- Is this a strong or weak inductive argument? Why?

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

**Ok, where do we end up on this debate?**

<br>

**Any questions on the basics of an argument diagram we covered today in class?**
