Today we explore the stakes of the upcoming election in terms of the issues that matter to us on a local level

<br>

As I mentioned last week, I think the media's focus on the "race" part of the election is often a distraction

- In a democracy we elect leaders to solve problems, so let's talk about the problems we care about!

<br>

*Go around the room hearing about the LOCAL issues people care about!*

- *Keep track ON BOARD*

::: notes

There's a lot of truth to this meme

- So much of our attention is consumed by the national level noise

- But SO MUCH MORE of your day-to-day life is affected by what your local leaders do!

<br>

The taxes you pay the most often, the roads you drive on, the restaurants you dine in, what the schools teach, what crimes are focused on by law enforcement and on and on and on

- ALL of these are local issues 

- And yet purely local elections get teeny tiny voter turnout

<br>

**How do we change this? How do we get people excited for local government?**

::: notes

Next class we shift our focus from local to national problems.

<br>

To be very clear, I'm not looking for testimonials in support of, or in opposition to, one of the candidates. 

- I want us to talk about the issues we care about, not the personalities involved in the horse race.
