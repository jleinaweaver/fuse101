**Any questions on Farrell's advice?**

:::



## To be convincing an argument should be logical, clear, credible and critical {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

<br>

- **Logical**: Do the premises support the conclusion?

- **Clear**: Is the paper easy to read and understand?

- **Credible**: Is there enough high quality evidence (cited using APA)?

- **Critical**: Does the paper address weaknesses in the argument (e.g. logic, evidence, consider counter-arguments)?

::: notes

Don't forget our writing rubric!

- **Questions on this?**
