Today we explore the stakes of the upcoming election in terms of the issues that matter to us on a local level

<br>

As I mentioned last week, I think the media's focus on the "race" part of the election is often a distraction

- In a democracy we elect leaders to solve problems, so let's talk about the problems we care about!

<br>

*Go around the room hearing about the NATIONAL issues people care about!*

- *Keep track ON BOARD*
