SLIDE: Quick refresher - What is Fuse 101?

:::


## Fuse 101: Frontiers {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

<br>

Frontiers is the gateway course to Drury’s general education curriculum. It introduces students to academic work at the collegiate level and fosters their discovery within a community of the many educational pathways available to them at Drury. Each course section has its own theme, developed by faculty members from a wide variety of disciplines. Particular emphasis lies on developing students’ skills in writing, critical thinking and information literacy.

::: notes

As we talked about on Sunday, Fuse 101 is our welcome to Drury and welcome to the general education portion of your education.

- Meant to help you find your way on campus,

- Connect to a major advisor and campus department,

- and get you on a good plan to graduate!

<br>

**With time to sleep on it, any questions on these basics about Fuse 101?**

<br>

SLIDE: Let's now talk about the theme for our class!

:::


## Breaking News: The World Right Now {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

<br>

In this course we will use **current events** as a means for **learning** about the world, for **thinking critically** about where information comes from and for **debating** the importance of an informed electorate in a democracy.

::: notes

Our section of Fuse 101 will be organized around a theme of current events and breaking news.

<br>

No worries either way, but I have to ask:

- **How many people chose this section based on the theme and how many were simply assigned to this one?**

<br>

Either way, you are welcome to the class

- Just know that our main job in Fuse 101 is to set you up for success at Drury so the theme is somewhat irrelevant

- Our primary job focuses on teaching you writing, information literacy and navigating the Drury bureaucracy

<br>

But since you're here!

- I will ask each of you to keep an eye and an ear on the news this term!

<br>

**When you hear "current events" what do you think of?**

- **Can we define that concept?**

<br>

One possibility:

- "Event" means a singular happening, e.g. one thing
- "Current" means ongoing, e.g. happening now
- public events of import to a community and happening right now!

<br>

My hope is that our theme this semester helps you connect in meaningful ways to our community and our democracy!

## What are the five most important current events happening right now? {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

::: notes

Split up into small groups (3-4?), introduce yourselves and then work together to make a list of the five most important current events.

<br>

*ON BOARD: PRESENT and DISCUSS each list*

<br>

For each:

- What is the specific "event"?

- What makes it "big" or "important"?

<br>

**Could we rank these in terms of importance overall across all of the lists? Why or why not?**

<br>

SLIDE: Let's talk about the news for a sec...

:::



## How do you keep up with current events? {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

::: notes

**What are your primary news sources?**

- *ON BOARD*

<br>

**What is your current daily routine for "keeping up" with the news? Do you have a routine related to the news?**

<br>

**Bottom line, on a scale of 1 to 10 how well informed do you feel you are about today's news?**

- *ON BOARD*

<br>

I'm a bit crazy when it comes to the news and I think that is down to my chosen discipline, political science

- I try hard to stay VERY up-to-date

- Daily I try to keep up with the Washington Post, WSJ and NYT for national news 

- News Leader and the SGF Citizen for local news

- Foreign Policy magazine and political science research journals for specialized topics and analyses

<br>

SLIDE: Ok, last agenda item for today is to review the syllabus

::: notes

Make connections with the faculty!

- I'm going to keep harping on this "finding community" idea because I think it is super important.

<br>

One caution: Faculty are crazy busy so make sure to have a goal for the meeting.

- But that goal can simply be because you want to find out more about the teacher/their class and how that connects to your plans.

<br>

**Questions on this?**
