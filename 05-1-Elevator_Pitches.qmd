## {background-image="Images/05_1-elevator-pitch.png"}

::: notes

My plan for today is that everyone give us an "elevator pitch" for their chosen event.

<br>

**Is everybody familiar with this concept?**

- Imagine you have a 2 minute elevator ride with a person you want something from

- Can you effectively pitch your idea to someone in a compelling way in such a short time?

<br>

**Has anybody ever prepped this kind of exercise before?**

The most important current event of my lifetimes is X because...

::: notes

Take a few minutes to review your discussion post and prep your pitch for us.

- You have two minutes to sell us on your argument!

<br>

Let's now pair off, practice running your elevator pitch.

- Give each other feedback!

<br>

Ok, let's hear your pitches!

### What do you have to have completed before our next class?


::: notes

**Check the syllabus and Canvas modules and report back!**

<br>

Brainstorming Premises: Decide on your thesis for the first paper (e.g. your chosen "most important event") and brainstorm 10 reasons for this choice to Canvas. I know ten reasons feels like a ton, but the aim here is to force you to think deeply and widely about your chosen case. Remember, there are no bad ideas in a brainstorm!
