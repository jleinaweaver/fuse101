Fusion Certificate Day "in the FSC Ballroom on Tuesday, October 1 from 11-12. It is mandatory for all first-year students to attend, so please find a way to confirm that they were there. Last year, several faculty created an assignment, some included selfies, and a short essay on the event outlining their plans for certificates. It is also a great opportunity to begin the discussion about the upcoming registration process."
