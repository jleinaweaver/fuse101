Prep for Class

1. Update attendance list

2. Make sure course published on Canvas

<br>

Welcome to Drury!

- I can only begin to imagine the whirlwind you are caught up in right now.

<br>

**Is everybody doing ok?**

<br>

I promise you EVERYBODY is fried and a little overwhelmed at this point!

- Think of the proverbial duck on the pond: Looks calm on top but legs paddling insanely under the water

- Even the faculty since we're scrambling to get ready for the new semester!

Welcome to FUSE 101

- First year seminar everybody has to take.

- Think of Fuse 101 as your home base this Fall while you get situated on campus

<br>

Each section of FUSE 101 is taught by a different faculty member and each has its own theme

- I'm your host, Dr. Leinaweaver

- *Basics about you*

<br>

SLIDE: Let's talk big picture about this class

:::


## Fuse 101: Frontiers {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

<br>

**Frontiers is the gateway course to Drury’s general education curriculum.**

::: notes
In order to graduate all Drury students must complete the Fusion curriculum

- It's our version of a general ed requirement

- Fuse 101 is your first of these gen ed requirements and is meant to set you up for the rest

:::


## Fuse 101: Frontiers {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

<br>

Frontiers is the gateway course to Drury’s general education curriculum. **It introduces students to academic work at the collegiate level and fosters their discovery within a community of the many educational pathways available to them at Drury.**

::: notes

Two big goals of this class

1. Give you practice producing college-level work, and

2. Introducing you to the many, many options you have at Drury

:::


## Fuse 101: Frontiers {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

<br>

Frontiers is the gateway course to Drury’s general education curriculum. It introduces students to academic work at the collegiate level and fosters their discovery within a community of the many educational pathways available to them at Drury. **Each course section has its own theme, developed by faculty members from a wide variety of disciplines.**

::: notes

Each section of Fuse 101 has a different theme, e.g. organizing focus

- But really, the goals are the same across all of the sections regardless of theme

## Fuse 101: Frontiers {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

<br>

Frontiers is the gateway course to Drury’s general education curriculum. It introduces students to academic work at the collegiate level and fosters their discovery within a community of the many educational pathways available to them at Drury. Each course section has its own theme, developed by faculty members from a wide variety of disciplines. **Particular emphasis lies on developing students’ skills in writing, critical thinking and information literacy.**

::: notes

Every course at Drury must specify learning objectives

- e.g. the skills you will develop in the class

<br>

For Fuse 101 we have three primary LOs: writing, critical thinking and information literacy

- These will come up A LOT in your classes

<br>

SLIDE: HOWEVER, FUSE 101 also has a special, secret LO!

:::


## The Secret Learning Outcome! {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

<br>

**Our primary goal is to ensure everyone in this room connects to the Drury experience in meaningful ways.**

::: {.incremental}
- Finding and connecting to communities on campus

- Finding a major and a great advisor

- Navigating the Drury bureaucracy

- Planning your four years at Drury

- Scheduling for the Spring
:::

::: notes

**Our primary goal is to ensure everyone in this room connects to the Drury experience in meaningful ways.**

<br>

We are a team and I take this LO seriously.

- We are here to help each other find their people, programs, classes, money, whatever!

<br>

College can be a phenomenal experience, but it can easily get overwhelming.

- One of your jobs is to find a community or communities you can connect to that will support you through thick and thin.

- Our class can be one of those communities for you.

<br>

My plan is to start each of our classes with check-in time to see if anybody has tried something new to share, is running into any troubles we could help with or if you just need to vent.

- **Sound good?**

<br>

So, let's check in!

- **Has anybody learned something useful they could share with us? Cleanest bathroom? Best food?**

- **Has anybody run into an obstacle or an annoyance we can help with?**

- **Anybody just need to vent?**

<br>

SLIDE: In the spirit of this LO, let's talk first week of classes for a sec!

:::

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/01_1-tasting_menu.jpg")
```

::: notes

First week of classes is like trying out the tasting menu at a restaurant.

- The chef sends out a bunch of small samples of their food and you get to experience it all

<br>

Approach your first week of classes like this!

- Go see what each professor and class is set up to offer and take some time to think about if that's what you want to spend the next four months working on!

- If not, we may be able to make a few changes

<br>

Be aware, some things aren't droppable depending on your majors/minors/etc, but many things might be.

<br>

And if too many of your major classes suck, that might tell you something about your fit in the major.

<br>

Remember, college shouldn't feel like it is being done to you.

- Own this process and your choices.

<br>

**Sound good?**

<br>

SLIDE: Let's now talk about the theme for our class!

:::




## Breaking News: The World Right Now {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

<br>

In this course we will use **current events** as a means for **learning** about the world, for **thinking critically** about where information comes from and for **debating** the importance of an informed electorate in a democracy.

::: notes

Our section of Fuse 101 will be organized around a theme of current events and breaking news.

<br>

No worries either way, but I have to ask:

- **How many people chose this section based on the theme and how many were simply assigned to this one?**

<br>

Either way, you are welcome to the class

- Just know that our main job in Fuse 101 is to set you up for success at Drury so the theme is somewhat irrelevant

- Our primary job focuses on teaching you writing, information literacy and navigating the Drury bureaucracy

<br>

But since you're here!

- I will ask each of you to keep an eye and an ear on the news this term!

<br>

**When you hear "current events" what do you think of?**

- **Can we define that concept?**

<br>

One possibility:

- "Event" means a singular happening, e.g. one thing
- "Current" means ongoing, e.g. happening now
- public events of import to a community and happening right now!

<br>

My hope is that our theme this semester helps you connect in meaningful ways to our community and our democracy!

:::



## What are the five most important current events happening right now? {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

::: notes

Split up into small groups (3-4?), introduce yourselves and then work together to make a list of the five most important current events.

<br>

*ON BOARD: PRESENT and DISCUSS each list*

<br>

For each:

- What is the specific "event"?

- What makes it "big" or "important"?

<br>

**Could we rank these in terms of importance overall across all of the lists? Why or why not?**

<br>

SLIDE: Let's talk about the news for a sec...

:::



## How do you keep up with current events? {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

::: notes

**What are your primary news sources?**

- *ON BOARD*

<br>

**What is your current daily routine for "keeping up" with the news? Do you have a routine related to the news?**

<br>

**Bottom line, on a scale of 1 to 10 how well informed do you feel you are about today's news?**

- *ON BOARD*

<br>

I'm a bit crazy when it comes to the news and I think that is down to my chosen discipline, political science

- I try hard to stay VERY up-to-date

- Daily I try to keep up with the Washington Post, WSJ and NYT for national news 

- News Leader and the SGF Citizen for local news

- Foreign Policy magazine and political science research journals for specialized topics and analyses

<br>

SLIDE: Let's get set up for the week!

## {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png"}

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/01_1-Drury_Homepage.png")

::: notes

Have a volunteer log onto Canvas on the big screen and step through our course page, focus on navigation (have everyone try to log in on their own device as well)

- The main page
- The assignments page
- The grades page
- The modules page has all the readings and assignments
- The syllabus

<br>

**Any questions on logging into or navigating around Canvas?**

- Office hours and location

- Components of the grade

- Participation points

- Attendance cliff

- Excused absences: **It is your responsibility to email me BEFORE the absence in order to receive a make-up assignment.**

For talking about:

- Class material
- Assgnments and grades
- Scheduling
- Your major
- Finding an advisor
- Your future
::::

::: notes

Make connections with the faculty!

- I'm going to keep harping on this "finding community" idea because I think it is super important.

<br>

One caution: Faculty are crazy busy so make sure to have a goal for the meeting.

- But that goal can simply be because you want to find out more about the teacher/their class and how that connects to your plans.
