Prep for Class

1. Update attendance list

2. Make sure course published on Canvas

3. Have all needed forms for service plunge

<br>

Welcome to Drury!

- I can only begin to imagine the whirlwind you are caught up in right now.

- **Is everybody doing ok?**

<br>

I promise you EVERYBODY is fried and a little overwhelmed at this point!

- Think of the proverbial duck on the pond: Looks calm on top but legs paddling insanely under the water

- Even the faculty since we're scrambling to get ready for the new semester!

<br>

Welcome to FUSE 101

- First year seminar everybody has to take.

- Think of Fuse 101 as your home base this Fall while you get situated on campus

<br>

Each section of FUSE 101 is taught by a different faculty member and each has its own theme

- I'm your host, Dr. Leinaweaver

- **Is everybody in the right place?**

::: notes

I need to start learning names and we all need to get to know each other

<br>

1. I'm Dr. Justin Leinaweaver.

2. I'm a political scientist
    - FSU undergrad: poli sci and history
    - UCD masters in IR
    - TCD PhD in poli sci
    
3. I was born in Douglasville, Georgia, but spent most of my childhood in Florida

4. A decade ago my wife and I traveled across Italy and those meals were AWESOME
    - Pastas in Florence
    - Pizzas in Rome
    - And the greatest dessert of my life was a zabaione in a restaurant beside the Trevi Fountain
    
<br>

Your turn!

<br>

SLIDE: Let me introduce Fuse 101 to you by stepping through its description in the course catalog

:::


## Fuse 101: Frontiers {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

<br>

**Frontiers is the gateway course to Drury’s general education curriculum (1/4).**

::: notes
First sentence from the course catalog!

<br>

In order to graduate all Drury students must complete the Fusion curriculum

- It's our version of a general ed requirement

- Fuse 101 is your first of these gen ed requirements and is meant to set you up for the rest

:::


## Fuse 101: Frontiers {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

<br>

**It introduces students to academic work at the collegiate level and fosters their discovery within a community of the many educational pathways available to them at Drury (2/4).**

::: notes
Second sentence!

<br>

Two big goals of this class

1. Give you practice producing college-level work, and

2. Introducing you to the many, many options you have at Drury

:::


## Fuse 101: Frontiers {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

<br>

**Each course section has its own theme, developed by faculty members from a wide variety of disciplines (3/4).**

::: notes
Third sentence!

<br>

Each section of Fuse 101 has a different theme, e.g. organizing focus

- But really, the goals are the same across all of the sections regardless of theme

:::



## Fuse 101: Frontiers {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

<br>

**Particular emphasis lies on developing students’ skills in writing, critical thinking and information literacy (4/4).**

::: notes
Fourth and final sentence!

<br>

Every course at Drury must specify learning objectives

- e.g. the skills you will develop in the class

<br>

For Fuse 101 we have three primary LOs: writing, critical thinking and information literacy

- These will come up A LOT in your classes

<br>

SLIDE: Put it all together!

Frontiers is the gateway course to Drury’s general education curriculum.

Each course section has its own theme, developed by faculty members from a wide variety of disciplines. Particular emphasis lies on developing students’ skills in writing, critical thinking and information literacy.

::: notes

The academic course catalog is a handy resource for knowing a great deal about any class you are considering enrolling in!

- In this case especially, the catalog description guides the faculty in designing their sections of this course

<br>

SLIDE: One super important thing NOT in this catalog description is what many of us refer to as the special, secret learning outcome for FUSE 101

:::


## Fuse 101: Our Most Important Goal! {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

<br>

**Our primary goal is to ensure everyone in this room connects to the Drury experience in meaningful ways.**

::: {.incremental}
- Finding and connecting to communities on campus

- Finding a major and a great advisor

- Navigating the Drury bureaucracy

- Planning your four years at Drury

- Scheduling for the Spring
:::

::: notes

**Our primary goal is to ensure everyone in this room connects to the Drury experience in meaningful ways.**

<br>

We are a team and I take this LO seriously.

- We are here to help each other find their people, programs, classes, money, whatever!

<br>

College can be a phenomenal experience, but it can easily get overwhelming.

- One of your jobs is to find a community or communities you can connect to that will support you through thick and thin.

- Our class can be one of those communities for you.

<br>

My plan is to start each of our classes with check-in time to see if anybody has tried something new to share, is running into any troubles we could help with or if you just need to vent.

- **So, anybody made on any progress on this goal during the orientation?**

<br>

SLIDE: In the spirit of this LO, let's talk about your first week of classes!

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/01_1-tasting_menu.jpg")
```

::: notes

First week of classes is like trying out the tasting menu at a restaurant.

- The chef sends out a bunch of small samples of their food and you get to experience it all

<br>

Approach your first week of classes like this!

- Go see what each professor and class is set up to offer and take some time to think about if that's what you want to spend the next four months working on!

- If not, we may be able to make a few changes

<br>

Be aware, some things aren't droppable depending on your majors/minors/etc, but many things might be.

<br>

And if too many of your major classes suck, that might tell you something about your fit in the major.

<br>

Remember, college shouldn't feel like it is being done to you.

- Own this process and your choices.

<br>

**Sound good?**

<br>

SLIDE: Let's talk housekeeping for our class
