## Learning Outcomes {background-image="Images/background-gentle_lines_v3.png" .center}

<br>

Over the course of FUSE 101 and FUSE 102, students develop their capacities in Writing, Critical Thinking, and Information Literacy.

::: notes

Every class in college is organized around a series of LOs.

Always a good idea to make sure you are clear on the LOs when choosing a class and as guidance during the semester to make sure you are focusing on the right things.

All fuse 101 sections have the same set of LOs.

SLIDES x 4

:::



## Learning Outcomes {background-image="Images/background-gentle_lines_v3.png" .center}

<br>

**Writing**

Students write frequently and in a wide variety of modes, from narratives to arguments, in order to develop clarity and directness of prose, effective paragraph structure, and modern English usage.


## Learning Outcomes {background-image="Images/background-gentle_lines_v3.png" .center}

<br>

**Critical Thinking**

Students meaningfully present, interpret, and evaluate supporting and opposing evidence, and are able to identify underlying assumptions in arguments and to articulate the implications that follow from holding a particular position.



## Learning Outcomes {background-image="Images/background-gentle_lines_v3.png" .center}

<br>

**Information Literacy**

Students demonstrate the ability to find and evaluate relevant sources and use the sources effectively in their work.



## The Secret Learning Outcome! {background-image="Images/background-gentle_lines_v3.png" .center}

<br>

**Our primary goal is to ensure everyone in this room connects to the Drury experience in meaningful ways.**

::: {.incremental}
- Finding and connecting to communities on campus

- Finding a major and a great advisor

- Navigating the Drury bureaucracy

- Planning your four years at Drury

- Scheduling

The secret / unwritten LO!

**Our primary goal is to ensure everyone in this room connects to the Drury experience in meaningful ways.**

+ Finding and connecting to communities on campus
+ Finding a major and a great advisor
+ Navigating the Drury bureaucracy
+ Planning your four years at Drury
+ Scheduling


We are a team and I take this LO seriously.

We are here to help each other find their people, programs, classes, money, whatever!

College can be a phenomenal experience, but it can easily get overwhelming.

One of your jobs is to find a community or communities you can connect to that will support you through thick and thin.

Our class can be one of those communities for you.

My plan is to start each of our classes with check-in time to see if anybody has tried something new to share, is running into any troubles we could help with or if you just need to vent.

QUESTIONS ON THIS?


So, let's check in!

How are we doing so far?

Can we help you with anything? Need to vent?

:::



## Our Section of Fuse 101 {background-image="Images/background-gentle_lines_v3.png" .center}

<br>

In this course we will use **current events** as a means for **learning** about the world, for **thinking critically** about where information comes from and for **debating** the importance of an informed electorate in a democracy.

::: notes

This means YOU will need to keep an ear on the news this term!

WHAT DO WE MEAN BY "CURRENT EVENTS"?

We need to define our terms to make sure we're all on the same page from the get-go.

*ON BOARD*

1. Define "current" and "events"

- on own
- pairs
- class


2. Now combined this concept should probably be more than the sum of these two parts, right?

We all understand I mean more than just any "thing" happening "now."

So, let's define: "current events"


- "Event" means a singular happening, e.g. one thing
- "Current" means ongoing, e.g. happening now
- public events of import to a community and happening right now!

<br>

Let's jump on Canvas and grab what we need for laying out our semester

Essentially broken into three parts

Don't stress these papers.

We'll build up to writing each of them in class.

knitr::include_graphics("Images/01_1-participation-points.jpg")
```

::: notes
Ok, so I've got you coming to class now how do I make sure you're engaged?

- Participation points!

<br>

Basically, if you:

- Get to class on time,

- Have the materials you need to work, and

- Submit all daily required assignments BEFORE class,

You'll be good to go and these are easy free points.

<br>

Before most classes we will have a reading and a discussion question.

- You must submit your answer to that question on our Canvas discussion board BEFORE class begins to earn your participation point.

- The syllabus is marked for all class sessions that have a pre-class assignment

<br>

### Important note: Canvas will not tell you about discussion post requirements in your to do list. You have to keep track using the syllabus.

<br>

### Each participation point you lose will reduce your participation grade by 1/3 of a letter grade

### - e.g. A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, etc.

## The Attendance Cliff {background-image="Images/background-gentle_lines_v3.png"}

```

::: notes

The only way I can ensure everyone makes progress on the LOs is by being in class and doing the work.

This means I have to make sure you are here!

SLIDE

So, this class has an attendance cliff.

If you have more than five unexcused absences during the semester you will not be able to earn greater than a C+.

Regardless of assignment grades.


Now, those are unexcused absences only.

```{r, fig.align='center'}

```

::: notes
What if you have an excused absence coming up?

- **It is your responsibility to email me BEFORE the absence in order to receive a make-up assignment.**

- Easy peasy

<br>

This is also the place where I say to you, whatever is going on that might keep you out of class, please keep me in the loop. 

- I genuinely want you to make progress on our learning outcomes

<br>

So, if things are getting rough for you please come talk to me.

### I will always offer you flexibility in the face of struggle IF YOU COME TO ME BEFORE DEADLINES HAVE PASSED!

::: notes

Make connections with the faculty!

I'm going to keep harping on this "finding community" idea because I think it is super important.

One caution: Faculty are crazy busy so make sure to have a goal for the meeting.

But that goal can simply be because you want to find out more about the teacher/their class and how that connects to your plans.

::: notes

Your first job is to download the syllabus from Moodle and read it carefully.

It includes detail on everything you need to know.
- Assignment deadlines
- Readings
- Drury policies




There's always something to do for class.

Check the syllabus and be prepared!

Everybody grab the syllabus and look at our tasks fro Wednesday and Friday.

QUESTIONS?

- Wednesday you have to go to opening convo, Friday we have a reading to discuss.

```

::: notes

Last thing.

SLIDE

Think about your first week of classes like trying out the tasting menu at a restaurant.

Go check out your classes, give them a try and if you don't want them we have time to change your schedule.

Some things aren't droppable depending on your programs, but many things might be.

And if too many of your major classes suck, that might tell you something about your fit in the major.

Remember, college shouldn't feel like it is being done to you.

Own this process and your choices.

See you at convo on Wednesday!
