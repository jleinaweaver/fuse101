M: (Farrell 2010) FA21 5.1 - Discuss Farrell's advice, work to develop an outline, get and give feedback

- IMPORTANT: Add discussion of AI tools. Don't use them. Even tools like Grammarly that just promise to help with grammar. We want YOU to become excellent writers and that requires seeing where YOU are right NOW. Not about where you wish you were now.


Prep for Class

1. Check Canvas submissions

2. Prep new discussion board

3. Open news web pages for prompts to discuss
    - CNN, NYT, Washington Post, The Guardian, Irish Times, etc.

LIFE CHECK-IN: EVERYBODY DOING OK? NEED ANYTHING?

Current Events Check-in

SO, WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD SINCE WE MET LAST WEEK?

- WHAT BIG STORIES ARE YOU FOLLOWING / INTERESTED IN? WHY?

- ANYTHING HERE IN TOWN OR ON OUR CAMPUS WE SHOULD BE KEYED IN TO?

Let's talk about Farrell's (2010) advice on writing.

I know most of this is common sense, but let's reinforce these very important pieces of advice.

:::



## Farrell's (2010) Writing Advice {background-image="Images/background-gentle_lines_v3.png" .center}

<br>

1. Read the Requirements for the Assignment

::: notes
**What's the advice in the "read the requirements for the assignment" section?**

<br>

(Make sure you are answering the question that was asked!)

- I see this a lot and it results in a much lesser grade than the work might otherwise deserve.

<br>

Also, don't try to kill two birds with one stone (e.g. one paper for two classes)

- It is WAY harder than you think to write one paper to cover two separate class prompts. 

- Plagiarism

<br>

Also, a good chance to reinforce our AI policy in this class (as specified by the syllabus)

- You may not use AI tools on these papers

- That includes both chatGPT style generators that write from scratch or Grammarly style tools that simply clean up your writing

- One of my primary goals in this class is to help you become a better writer. I can't do that unless I see your actual writing in the assignments.

## Farrell's (2010) Writing Advice {background-image="Images/background-gentle_lines_v3.png" .center}

<br>

1. Read the Requirements for the Assignment

2. Avoid Data Dumps

::: notes
**What's the advice in the "avoid data dumps" section?**

<br>

(You may know a lot of stuff about a topic, but "stuff" is not the same thing as an argument)

- In fact, a long litany of stuff typically undermines your argument because it is distracting and confusing.

- For today you each produced 10 supporting reasons for your argument but in the final paper more is almost never better (if not tightly connected).

<br>

1. Read the Requirements for the Assignment

2. Avoid Data Dumps

3. Cut to the Chase

::: notes
**What's the advice in the "cut to the chase" section?**

1) Make sure your argument paper gets to making its argument from the get-go
- No, "since the beginning of time" or "Webster's dictionary defines..."

<br>

2) (Focus your introduction on making three things clear:)
1. What is the question?

2. Why should we care?

3. What is your argument.

<br>

3) (Focus every paragraph on your argument!)
- No background for the sake of background

    - **Macro Structure**

::: notes

### According to Farrell, what is a good macro structure?
- (Every paper should have a clear beginning, middle and end)

- This is probably the basic advice you've been getting since grade school.

- Tell me what you're gonna tell me, tell me and tell me what you told me.

<br>

### How do you demonstrate in the outline that your macro structure is good?
- (Differentiate the introduction from the body of the paper from the conclusion.)

    - **Meso Structure**

::: notes

### What is a good meso structure?
- (Each paragraph should build support for your argument.)

- (Each paragraph should focus on one main point.)

- (The point of each paragraph should build on that in the previous paragraph, and create the foundations of the next.)

<br>

In other words, your meso structure is taken care of if you clearly diagram your argument, premises to the conclusion, before you start writing.

- The work you've done this week in building that diagram is the work you need to outline and write a well structured argument paper.

<br>

### What is the exercise Farrell proposes you use to check the meso structure of an argument paper?
1. (Summarize each paragraph in one sentence.)

2. (Read the summary sentences only and the paper should both make sense AND build logically.)

<br>

### What does it mean if you can't summarize the paragraph in one sentence?
- (Paragraph is doing too much.)

<br>

I cannot emphasize this enough.
- You should check your meso structure every time you write a paper!

- An argument with a bad meso structure will NEVER be convincing.

- No amount of evidence and critical analysis can overcome this weakness.

<br>

A weak argument with an awesome meso structure CAN still be effective.
- The easier it is for the reader to follow the argument, the more likely they will be convinced.

<br>

### Does that make sense?

4. Organize, Organize, Organize
    - **Micro Structure**

::: notes

### What is a good micro structure?
1. (Sentences must be well constructed: Simple words, simple sentences, direct active language, no spelling or grammatical mistakes.)

2. (Each sentence should flow logically, from one to the next.)

<br>

### Any questions on the three types of structure Farrell describes?

4. Organize, Organize, Organize

5. Exercises in Style

::: notes

### Last one, 5. what's the advice in the "exercises in style" section?

- (Use "simple, direct writing, which communicates its arguments and evidence as clearly and unambiguously as possible" p6)

- Use the active voice (subject acts upon its verb) not passive (subject is a recipient of a verb’s action)
    - e.g. Israel is threatening to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities NOT Iranian nuclear facilities are under Israeli threat.

- Simple words are better than complex words

- Simple sentences are better than complex ones.

<br>

### Any questions on the advice in the Farrell reading?
:::


## To be convincing an argument should be logical, clear, credible and critical {background-image="Images/background-gentle_lines_v3.png" .center}

::: notes

All of this good advice is, hopefully, represented by our class writing rubric.

- Remember, our class writing rubric tells you that a convincing an argument should be logical, clear, credible and critical.

<br>

I grade using this rubric.

- **SLIDE**: Basically, I read your paper and then ask myself four questions.
:::


## To be convincing an argument should be logical, clear, credible and critical {background-image="Images/background-gentle_lines_v3.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.incremental}

- **Logical**: Do the premises support the conclusion?

- **Clear**: Is the paper easy to read and understand?

- **Credible**: Is there enough high quality evidence (cited using APA)?

- **Critical**: Does the paper address weaknesses in the argument (e.g. logic, evidence, consider counter-arguments)?
:::

::: notes
A very good series of questions to ask yourself before submitting!

### Any questions on the rubric or my expectations?
:::



## Outlining an Argument Paper {background-image="Images/background-blue_triangles2.png" .center .smaller}

**Intro**

- What is the question?
- Why do we care?
- Thesis statement

**Reason 1 (premise)**

**Reason 2 (premise)**

**Reason 3 (premise)**

**Reason X...**


::: notes

Ok, that's a lot of background info.

Today, I want everyone to take some time to convert their current argument diagram into an outline of their paper. (10 mins?)

This means an intro section with three complete sentences, and
- What is the question?
- Why do we care?
- Thesis statement

Your premises written as complete sentences that clearly advance your argument in a logical order.

QUESTIONS ON THIS?

In ten minutes or so we'll share outlines to get feedback.




Pairs: Share and get feedback
- Help your partner think about the rubric and the clarity of the premises.




New pairs: Share and get feedback




Time to reflect: Think about the feedback and revise to strengthen your outline.
