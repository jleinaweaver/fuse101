Prep for Class

1. Grade daily assignment

2. Print a bunch of blank planners for class

<br>

**Did everybody earn their participation point for today?**

- **How?**

- (Complete the pre-class assignment and bring all syllabi to class!)

<br>

Two big jobs for today

1. Dig into your course syllabi, and

2. Develop a first draft of your weekly planner

<br>

SLIDE: But first, we gotta check in!

Let's dig into your course syllabi

- Form NEW small groups (3-4?) with people who are NOT in the same classes as you!

<br>

GROUPS: Compare and contrast the syllabi from your classes

- How are they similar and how are they different?

- Get ready to report back!

<br>

**Key similarities across the syllabi in your group?**

- *ON BOARD*

- Drury policies, LOs, office hours, assignment deadlines, grade breakdown, etc

<br>

**What's the takeaway from this for us?**

- (The syllabi are worth WAY MORE than their weight in gold!)

- (Check the syllabus!)

## Planning for Success: The Semester {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

<br>

### Make a list of the big deadlines across all of your classes this semester

- e.g. tests scheduled, paper due dates, etc

::: {.fragment}
### Fuse 101

- Oct 4th: Paper 1 draft
- Oct 18th: Paper 1 final
- Nov 25th: Paper 2 draft
- Dec 11th: Paper 2 final
:::

::: notes

Now we work to get ahead!

- Everybody take out a blank piece of paper and use it to make a master list of all the big deadlines across your classes

- Let's keep this focused on assignments that will require prep beyond what you need for a normal class day

- Think tests, paper deadlines, that kind of thing

<br>

REVEAL: For example, in our class we have no tests and two main papers

- We'll have a number of smaller assignments throughout the semester, but these are the deadlines related to projects that will require extra time to prepare.

<br>

**Exercise make sense?**

- Get to it!

<br>

**How did that go? Any classes where it was tough to identify the big deadlines?**

<br>

My advice is that you take this list and add it to your personal calendar

- Add in reminders too!

- Big projects/deadlines should get a 2 week reminder, smaller projects maybe a 1 week reminder

<br>

THIS is how you stay on top of your semester!

<br>

**Questions?**

Compass Center example of a weekly planner

- Hour by hour breakdown

- 5 categories of task: work, class, review, study, preview

<br>

Everybody try this exercise on one of the blank planners on Canvas to outline your schedule for next week

1. Add the fixed requirements: Classes, travel time, work shifts, sports training or games, etc

2. Build in the healthy times: Exercise, eating, sleeping, time to relax, etc

3. What about getting ahead? Any open slots for class prep and study?

<br>

When done, compare with the people around you. Did they include anything you should add?

<br>

**How did that go?**

- **Any important takeaways that we need to be aware of if our goal is to keep you healthy, happy and successful?**

<br>

I will ask each of you to submit a completed weekly planner ahead of our first advising meeting in Week 4 of the class.

- Show me what a typical week for you looks like.

- We'll talk more about this assignment in a few weeks

### What do you have to have completed before our next class?


::: notes

**Check the syllabus and Canvas modules and report back!**

-  (Kovach & Rosenstiel 2011 Chapter 3)

- (ASSIGNMENT - Your Daily News Diet: After reading Kovach & Rosenstiel I want you to reflect on where you get most of your news day-to-day (e.g. sources and services).

1. What are your primary news sources? How do you access them?

2. Classify your typical sources by their "model" of journalism. What proportion of your news is each type?

3. How well do your typical news sources provide what you need to practice the six elements of "skeptical knowing"?
