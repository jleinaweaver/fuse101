:::

::: notes

NO CLASS NEXT WEEK!

<br>

INSTEAD, I will meet with each of you one-on-one in my office

- Available appointments are on the Canvas calendar tool

- Link to instructions is on Canvas Modules ([how-to link](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-sign-up-for-a-Scheduler-appointment-in-the-Calendar-as/ta-p/536))

- You MUST sign up for one of the slots and meet with me

<br>

**REGARDLESS of when we meet, you must submit TWO assignments to Canvas before 11am on Monday (normal class time)**

1. Design a weekly class / study / work schedule that represents your typical week (using the template from our work in week 1), AND

2. A short essay: "What are THREE specific things you want to accomplish during your time at Drury? (e.g. skills to learn, experiences to have, classes to take, etc.)"

<br>

In our meeting we'll get a chance to touch base and discuss these two things

<br>

So, everybody MUST sign up for one of the meetings next week!

- **Any questions on our plan for next week?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Back to our work for today!

## For Today {background-image="Images/background-blue_triangles2.png" .center}

<br>

```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/03_2-Assignment.png")
```

::: notes

For today I asked everyone to find us an argument from the opinion pages of a mainstream media newspaper.

<br>

Our plan for today is to use the arguments in your chosen op-eds to help us practice making counter-arguments

<br>

SLIDE: But first, let's talk about counter-arguments!

:::



## Graff and Birkenstein (2018) {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/03_2-Counter_Args.gif")
```

::: notes

**Why do Graff and Birkenstein (2018) argue that this is exactly the wrong way to think about counter-arguments?**

- **Big picture, how should we think about writing an argument according to these authors?**

<br>

"Indeed, no single device more quickly improves a piece of writing than planting a naysayer in the text..." (p78)

- Writing a convincing argument is engaging in a conversation with the reader, NOT you presenting "uncontroversial truths in a vacuum" (78).

:::



## Graff and Birkenstein (2018) {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/03_2-Counter_Arg_meme.jpg")
```

::: notes

**In what three ways do these authors argue that including counter-arguments makes our work stronger?**

1. Giving voice to a criticism and then addressing that criticism disarms those critics (even if they don't completely buy your explanation)

2. Show respect to your readers, treat them like "independent, critical thinkers"

3. Show yourself to be open-minded and confident in your argument

4. (Bonus benefit) Flesh out that word count!

<br>

**According to the chapter, what are the two conditions you must meet for a counter-argument to make your work stronger instead of weaker?**

1. p85: You must represent the objections fairly
    - This means presnting the strongest possible version of their objection!
    
2. p86: you must answer the objections persuasively!
    - Useful hint: Treat the objection as a chance to refine your position rather than taking the position that the objection is worthless
    
    - Accept part of the critique and show how you adapt to it or deal with it
    
    - "yes, but" or "yes and no"
    
<br>

**Questions on the counter-argument advice in the chapter?**

<br>

SLIDE: Let's practice!

## Practice Making a Counter-Argument {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/03_2-Assignment.png")
```

::: notes

Split class into 3 groups

<br>

Task 1: Review the op-eds submitted by the members of your group

- Pick one argument you'd like to work on today (e.g. one argument you'd like to counter!)

<br>

Task 2: Read the cited article and revise the argument diagram

- Get that diagram up on the board!

<br>

Task 3: Propose a counter-argument to the op-ed

- 3 premises and a conclusion!

<br>

Task 4: Propose a "persuasive" counter-argument to the counter-argument!

- Use one of the templates from the chapter

## Using Counter-Arguments to Strengthen your Arguments {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/03_2-Counter_Arg_meme2.jpg")
```

::: notes

Ok, each group I want you to present the original argument + your counter to the counter argument

- The idea is that you are taking on the role of the original author. Make sense?

- Go!

<br>

**Did the counter-argument make the original argument stronger or not?**

<br>

**Any questions on the power of counter-arguments?**

:::



## Paper 1 {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

<br>

### What was the the single most important "current" event of the last 18 years WITHIN the borders of the United States?

::: notes

The first argument paper you will write for this class will represent an answer to this question.

<br>

We will build this paper working together over the next few weeks in class

- **In the meantime, any questions about the prompt?**

<br>

SLIDE: To get you moving on this we have an assignment due for a week from Monday (e.g. after our week of one-on-one meetings).

```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/03_2-Assign_for_Next.png")
```

::: notes

Due BEFORE class on September 16th

- You have over a week to get ready for this, but don't let it fall off your radar!

<br>

**Questions on the assignment?**

<br>

**IMPORTANT**: You cannot submit an event that has already been claimed!

- The idea is that we collect a bunch of different ideas not generate a consensus on the most obvious pick 

<br>

Ok, don't forget to sign up for a meeting for next week and get those assignments done!
