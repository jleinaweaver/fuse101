## Citations are NOT optional {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

Important lesson for all the work you'll do in college: Citations are NOT optional

<br>

By "citations" I mean that we create knowledge by standing on the shoulders of those who came before us

- We use citations to give credit to the sources of the ideas we are drawing on

<br>

Each discipline tends to use a different style for its citations

- Your job is to learn how to use ALL of the big ones, NOT to adopt just one for the rest of your lives

<br>

Think of these like tools in your toolbox

- A good carpenter needs to know how to use a hammer AND a screwdriver

<br>

**Questions on this big idea?**

I'm a professor of political science, SO for my class you will be using APA.

<br>

For your assignment today I asked you to submit APA citations, so let's check them.

- Everybody take a moment to skim all the submissions in the discussion board.

- Check to make sure all of the citations are correctly in APA format.

<br>

**Any citations we need to correct?**

<br>

**What questions do you have about APA formatting?**

::: notes

For today I asked each of you to reflect on the advice in the Engle (2018) reading in order to find and submit an example of high quality and low quality evidence.

- Let's dig into what you submitted.

<br>

Make small groups (3-4)

- Go sit with your group!

<br>

GROUPS: Review all of the high quality evidence that was submitted to our discussion board

1. Do you agree that all of the submissions are high quality?

2. LIST: What are the key characteristics you look for in high quality evidence?

<br>

*ON BOARD*: Give me your lists of key characteristics (round-robin style)

<br>

**Did any group want to question the inclusion of one piece of evidence as "high quality"? Anything debatable?**

::: notes
GROUPS: Now I want you to review all of the low quality evidence that was submitted to our discussion board

- **Important question, in what ways could you use the "low" quality evidence in an academic argument paper?**

- Groups, discuss what's on the list and then report back if you think any of this evidence is usable and how we could use it

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS*

**Evaluating the Quality of your Evidence**
:::

<br>

```{r, fig.align='center'}

```

::: notes

Per Engle, high quality evidence depends on:

- Author: Credentials, Affiliation, Frequently cited by experts

- Date: Up-to-date is preferred

- Edition or revision: Multiple editions imply demand; Revisions imply being kept up-to-date

- Publisher (if book): University press

- Title of journal: Scholarly journal
    - "Scholarly or peer-reviewed journal articles are written by scholars or professionals who are experts in their fields. In the sciences and social sciences, they often publish research results."

<br>

My two-cents: The Engle piece is a little too hung up on quality "flags" like degree earned and publisher

- High quality evidence should have the same qualities we expect from our own arguments

- Is it logical, clear, credible, and critical?

<br>

Keep in mind, the quality of the evidence at least **partially depends on what you are using it to do**.
