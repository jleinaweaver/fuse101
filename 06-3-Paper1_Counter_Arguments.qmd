<br>

SLIDE: Let's talk about the papers!
:::



## Paper 1 Prompt {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

<br>

### What was the the single most important "current" event of the last 18 years (e.g. your lifetime) WITHIN the borders of the United States?

::: notes

**Questions on the prompt for the first paper?**

<br>

Head's up that the first completed draft of the paper will be due October 4th

- We'll keep building up to it but I want to remind you of that deadline on the horizon
:::



## To be convincing an argument should be logical, clear, credible and critical {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

<br>

- **Logical**: Do the premises support the conclusion?

- **Clear**: Is the paper easy to read and understand?

- **Credible**: Is there enough high quality evidence (cited using APA)?

- **Critical**: Does the paper address weaknesses in the argument (e.g. logic, evidence, consider counter-arguments)?

::: notes

Today we focus on the fourth item in our rubric, critical analysis.

<br>

SLIDE: We've been working on these elements all week but let's clarify for a sec

:::



## Critical Analysis in an Argument Paper {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

<br>
 
Being as critical of your own work as you are of others

- e.g. Where is your logic and evidence weakest?

::: notes

On Wednesday you added evidence to your outline and then had to defend the quality of that evidence to your classmates

- THAT is one way we add critical analysis to an argument paper

- Making sure the reader understands why your evidence is sufficiently high quality for the job IS about making your argument more convincing

- **Make sense?**

<br>

A second way we add critical analysis is by addressing the strongest versions of any counter arguments

- **What was the advice from Graff and Birkenstein about strengthening your paper with counter-arguments?**

- Counter-arguments allow you to disarm your critics, show respect for your readers, show yourself as open-minded and to flesh out your word count

- BUT you must:
    1. p85: You must represent the objections fairly
    
    2. p86: you must answer the objections persuasively!

```

::: notes

Get with the person you exchanged papers with and discuss the counter-arguments they brainstormed for you

- Help each other pick the most useful one and think about what it would take to "persuasively" address it

- This means you need evidence in support of the counter-argument AND evidence you could use to address it

<br>

NEW PAIRS: Present your argument, your counter-argument and your idea for how to address it.

- Get feedback!

<br>

**How are we doing with this?**

- **Does everybody have a good counter-argument?**

- **Does everybody have a sense of how they will address it?**
