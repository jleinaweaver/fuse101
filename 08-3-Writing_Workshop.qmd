Prep for Class

1. TBD

<br>

Today's class time will be yours to work on and maybe even finish the paper revisions!

<br>

But first, let's talk assignment for next Monday!

- Next week I want us to explore our information ecosystems

- In other words, where do we get our information day-to-day and how high quality is the information we are getting?

<br>

For Monday you have a reading introducing you to some of the key concepts we'll need.

- SLIDE: Then an assignment to complete
