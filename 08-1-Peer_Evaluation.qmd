Prep for Class

1. Skip current events

2. Plan student pairs for evaluations

<br>

This week we work to improve the quality of all of your papers

- Writing a high quality paper is something that takes time, practice and revisions

- You will get better and better at this process only by doing it

- You have to get the reps in to get good at anything and that goes doubly for writing

<br>

That means I want you all to get lots of feedback on your first paper this week and then to use that feedback to improve the paper for another grade

- Worth more than the last paper in terms of your overall class grade (50 pts vs 100pts)

<br>

Plan of Attack

- Today we will do peer evaluations

- Wednesday I will get you my feedback on your papers

- You'll then have Friday in class to revise and resubmit your paper for a final grade

<br>

**Sound good?**

- SLIDE: Let's talk peer evaluations

Today I want you to practice evaluating each other's argument papers

- Peer editing is an invaluable skill to develop

- Makes you a more useful colleague, AND

- A MUCH better writer!

<br>

Funnily enough, you will find that seeing the flaws in someone else's writing is WAY easier than seeing it in our own

- Their work didn't come out of your head!

<br>

*Assign class into pairs*

<br>

Your job will be to read and reflect on your partner's paper and then SUBMIT an evaluation of the paper to the person AND to me.

- This is a graded assignment you will submit to Canvas

- You will have 20 minutes to complete your evaluation

<br>

SLIDE: Let's talk details

## Peer Evaluations {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

1. What are the strongest SPECIFIC aspects of the paper?

::: {.fragment}

2. Score and explain your grade for each criteria in the rubric:

    - Logic: Premises support the conclusion?
    
    - Clarity: Easy to read and understand?
    
    - Credibility: Enough high quality evidence?
    
    - Critical: Addresses weaknesses in the argument?
    
**Grade Scale**: 

- Not at all (1), Somewhat (2), Mostly (3), Completely (4)

Two parts to the evaluation

1. Highlight the strengths of the paper

2. REVEAL: Apply the rubric to the paper
    - Make sure to score **AND explain** your reasoning for each

<br>

Remember, we have two goals here

1. Give a classmate useful input to help them write a more convincing paper

2. This exercise is ultimately meant to help you reflect on your own work and to think more deeply about the elements of writing a convincing argument

<br>

**Any questions on the assignment?**

- I will be grading your evaluations so take it seriously.

- The better (meaning more thoughtful and helpful) your feedback, the better the grade

- Let's go!

- You have 20 minutes then submit this evaluation to Canvas AND email your feedback to the other person!
