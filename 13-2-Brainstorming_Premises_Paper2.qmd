## Paper 2 Prompt {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

<br>

### What was the the single most important "current" event of the last 18 years (e.g. your lifetime) OUTSIDE the borders of the United States?

::: notes

Here is the paper prompt you are all working on.

<br>

Last class we road-tested your ideas as elevator pitches to get them on their feet and to help you reflect on your choices

<br>

For today I asked you to brainstorm 10 possible reasons that support your argument

- e.g. possible premises for an argument paper.

<br>

SLIDE: Let's refresh our memories about what makes a "good" premise in an argument

:::



## A "good" premise is: {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
1. clear, 

2. a complete idea, 

3. logically connected to the conclusion, and 

4. could be supported by evidence.
:::

::: notes

- Clear: Keep it simple!

- Complete: A complete sentence

- Logic: Don't forget you are building a strong inductive argument

- Evidence: If no evidence exists to support this idea it will be much harder to sell it to the reader

<br>

**Any questions on them?**

<br>

Let's apply this to your brainstormed list

:::



## Brainstorming your Argument {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

<br>

On a blank piece of paper write your thesis statement across the top:

"X is the most important international current event of the last 18 years."

<br>

Add your brainstormed list of **10 reasons** you chose this case

- Make sure each reason is a "good" premise!

::: notes

Go!

<br>

Now, everybody stand up!

- Your job is to review everyone else's lists of reasons.

<br>

I want you to put a check mark next to the strongest premises on their lists

- Let's go!

<br>

Ok, go take a look at your list.

- Any surprises for you?

- Did everybody flag the premises you thought they would?
