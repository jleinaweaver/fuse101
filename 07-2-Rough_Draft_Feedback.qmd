Let's get into groups of three today.

- Work with new people!

<br>

I want you to spend some time focused on each paper in your group (12 mins each?)

- My advice: Don't try to rewrite their paper or advise them to write it the way you would.

- Your job, much harder, is to help them make THEIR paper better.

- Help them figure out the strongest version of their paper in their voice.

<br>

**REVEAL**

- Keep the rubric in mind, and flag these two things for them

- Go!

<br>

Group review done? Reflect on the feedback and write, write, write!

<br>

*Come back together at the end*

**Lessons so far?**

- **Things we are struggling with?**
