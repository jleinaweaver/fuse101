LIFE CHECK-IN: EVERYBODY DOING OK? NEED ANYTHING?

<br>

Current Events Check-in

SO, WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD SINCE WE MET LAST WEEK?

- WHAT BIG STORIES ARE YOU FOLLOWING / INTERESTED IN? WHY?

- ANYTHING HERE IN TOWN OR ON OUR CAMPUS WE SHOULD BE KEYED IN TO?

## Paper 1 Prompt {background-image="Images/background-blue_triangles_flipped.png" .center}

What is the single most important current event of the last 18 years?

**Assignment for Today:**

Reflect on our options and pick your case, e.g. your answer to the question in the paper prompt.

::: notes

IS EVERYBODY READY TO GO ON THIS?

<br>

Because this is our first stab at writing a paper, we're going to spend the next few weeks working on this in class.

Today we brainstorm argument diagrams.

:::



## Brainstorming your Argument {background-image="Images/background-gentle_lines_v3.png" .center}

On a blank piece of paper write your thesis statement across the top:

"X is the most important current event of the last 18 years."

::: notes

TBD

:::



## Brainstorming your Argument {background-image="Images/background-gentle_lines_v3.png" .center}

"X is the most important current event of the last 18 years."

Brainstorm a list of **10 reasons** you chose this case.

::: notes

Now, take 15 minutes to brainstorm a list of ten reasons for your choice.

Everybody has to come up with ten reasons, even if some of them aren't very good!

These must be complete sentences.

Go!

:::



## A "good" premise is: {background-image="Images/background-gentle_lines_v3.png" .center}

1. clear, 

2. a complete idea, 

3. logically connected to the conclusion, and 

4. could be supported by evidence.

::: notes

Introduce our working definition of a "good" premise.

A "good" premise is:
1. clear, 
2. a complete idea, 
3. logically connected to the conclusion, and 
4. could be supported by evidence.




Now, everybody stand up!

Your job is to review everyone else's lists of reasons.

I want you to put a check mark next to any reason you think meets our definition of a "good" premise.

Leave the rest blank.




Ok, go take a look at your list.

- Any surprises for you?

- Did everybody flag the premises you thought they would?





First, let's talk about what you got from reading other people's lists.

IN WHAT SPECIFIC WAYS DOES READING A BUNCH OF ARGUMENTS IN DEVELOPMENT HELP US DESIGN OUR OWN?

DID YOU IDENTIFY ANY COMPELLING IDEAS WORTH STEALING?

NO NAMES, BUT DID YOU IDENTIFY ANY TYPES OF REASON THAT REALLY DIDN'T WORK FOR YOU?
- STYLES / TONES OR APPROACHES?



OK, WHAT DO WE DO WITH THIS FEEDBACK? HOW DO WE PROCESS THE EVIDENCE YOU JUST RECEIVED?

- IN OTHER WORDS, SHOULD YOU FOLLOW THE CHECKS OR NOT?



WHAT DO YOU DO IF ONE OF THE REASONS YOU REALLY THINK IS KEY DIDN'T GET MANY CHECKS?
(- Don't give up on it; Revise, clarify, try explaining it differently)



ANY QUESTIONS ON WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN A STRONG PREMISE?
