## Kovach and Rosenstiel (2011) {background-image="Images/background-news_v2.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}
1. "The Way of Skeptical Knowing"

2. The News "Neighborhoods"
:::

::: notes

I like to use the Kovach and Rosenstiel chapter as a starting point for any class I teach that focuses on current events.

- Their entire book is designed to help us be better consumers of the news

- Specifically, these authors are trying to boost your "information literacy" skills

<br>

The chapter has two big and related ideas.

1. Skeptical knowing: There are steps we can follow to protect ourselves and generate real knowledge about the world.

2. We have to be aware of "the neighborhood" we are in when gathering the news.
    - They refer to these as the "Models of Journalism"

<br>

Form groups of 4, work with new people!

- Go sit with your groups!

**Models of Journalism**

- Verification Journalism

- Assertion Journalism

- Affirmation Journalism

- Interest-group Journalism

::: notes

Per the chapter there are four distinct models of journalism

- **Is everybody clear on each of these and the examples from the chapter?**

<br>

1. Verification Journalism: Characterized by "empiricism and humility", Multiple sources; Skepticism of claims by sources; Vetting of all claims; Provides context for understanding the "facts" being reported
2. Assertion Journalism: Fundamentally stenographic; Journalist as passive conduit / enabler for sources and newsmakers; Gives the sources more power because access, not truth, is everything; Bias towards speed over accuracy
3. Affirmation Journalism: Neo-partisan form of news; aim is to affirm the preconceptions of the audience; one-sided broadcast of cherry-picked facts; propaganda, persuasion and manipulation
4. Interest-group Journalism

<br>

Groups, make a list of the main sources and access points for news for the members of your group

- Audit how each source has been classified by its "model of journalism", make sure you all agree!

<br>

*ON BOARD*

- Round-robin by group: Give me a source and its "model" from your list

- *SHARE and DISCUSS each*

<br>

**Self reflection time: What proportion of the news you get day-to-day is verification journalism?**

<br>

**Which "model" do each of you tend to live in the most?**

<br>

**Are there any news sources today that are 100% verification journalism? Why or why not?**

<br>

As we can see, one big problem for us is that so much of the news we are inundated with these days is not "verification journalism."

- SLIDE: That means we absolutely need...

<br>

**"The Way of Skeptical Knowing"**

1. What kind of content is this?

2. Is the information complete? What is missing?

3. Who are the sources? Are they believable?

4. What is the evidence? How vetted?

5. What is a possible alternative explanation?

6. Am I learning what I need to?

::: notes

**What questions do you have about applying the six steps when evaluating a news story?**

<br>

That last point might need unpacking:

- Do our sources of news give us the info we need to evaluate their quality?
- Does this source tell me everything I need to know to understand the story?
- Is the author/creator resorting to jargon/gobbledygook to obscure?
- Does the author/creator provide enough background so we understand the topic clearly (e.g. focusing on a single study without provide the context of how it fits into the research landscape)?
    
<br>

Again, time for self reflection!

- **Be honest, what proportion of the six steps of skeptical knowing do you follow every time?**

- **Which ones most?**

- **Which ones least?**

<br>

**Is there a way to use skeptical knowing but still get all your news from affirmation type sources? Why or why not?**

**Bottom line, what are the key lessons for us as consumers of "the news"?**

- **Does this approach imply that we have to use multiple media sources to verify any piece of current events?**
