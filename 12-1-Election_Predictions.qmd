Alright, talk to me about your predictions here!

- **What do we learn from these?**

<br>

SLIDE: Interestingly, the answers differ across the two questions!

**What do we learn from this about your predictions?**

<br>

SLIDE: Let's talk confidence!

:::

  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:11)
```

::: notes

**For those who feel confident, why so?**

<br>

**For those who do not, why not?**

<br>

SLIDE: Let's add confidence to the mix!

**Do we learn anything from this approach?**

<br>

**Has viewing these other predictions changed your prediction for tomorrow? Why or why not?**

**So, what do we think happens tomorrow re the House of Representatives?**
